			<p>University is back in session, and so is recruiting for public accounting! As you&rsquo;re meeting the firms for the first time, here are a couple of pointers:</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH THE FIRMS </strong>(okay, just one pointer for this post.)</p>

<p>I know, people tell you to do it, your college hands you a guide to the accounting firms that recruit in your area, and there are 200 firms to look through, and you don&rsquo;t even know where to start looking. I always looked up accounting firm websites and just didn&rsquo;t know which information to pick out. Part of that was because I knew that I wanted to work audit, and I wanted a job, and beyond that I didn&rsquo;t really <em>care</em> so I didn&rsquo;t know which information remember and ask about!</p>

<p>Your mission: <strong>get familiar with what is &ldquo;the norm&rdquo; for accounting firms in your area, and take note of things that make each firm <em>different</em> than the norm. </strong>You don&rsquo;t need to memorize the firm&rsquo;s history, you just need to be able to say &ldquo;I was looking at your website, and saw xyz about you.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s best if you have a question to follow this factoid up with, but if delivered right, you can get away with just saying the fact &ldquo;Oh, your firm specializes in health care clients, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the last recruiting event I went to, I explained our basic differences from other firms to about 25 students. Only <em>one</em> of those students said &ldquo;Oh I read on your website that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It does make you stand out. Of course, you probably don&rsquo;t want to memorize a factoid for every single firm, but do your homework, figure out which firms you&rsquo;re most interested in, and go prepared with some basic knowledge on those, plus a few other firms. At these events, you never know which firm you&rsquo;re going to end up talking to, and it&rsquo;s hard to pick out from just looking at websites which firm is the right fit for you.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m going to provide a couple ideas to help you know which information to study and bring up at accounting recruiting events.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Be familiar with firm size and location.</strong></p>

<p>Most local accounting firms have only one office. If a firm that would otherwise be a local firm has another office in the city, mention that they have another location. Maybe ask why that came about. I would say that you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> need to memorize every firm&rsquo;s address, but it you really can&rsquo;t think of anything else to ask a small firm about, you can always say &ldquo;Oh you guys are located up on xyz st, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the firm has a couple of locations throughout the country, ask &ldquo;so you have offices in Chicago and NYC too, right? So does the firm have clients all over the country, or just in these 3 areas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking with a firm like Reznick Group or BDO Siedman you need to be familiar with the fact that they are big and nationwide! Just because a firm is not Big 4 does not mean that it does not expect you to recognize its name, and that it is a large company (just not huge like Big 4.)</p>

<p><em>Website Hint: Check out the part of the accounting firm&rsquo;s website called &ldquo;Locations.&rdquo; Remember that just because a location is listed, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a large office. That can be another question to ask.</em></p>

<p><strong>Be familiar with firm client base</strong></p>

<p>As a student, I didn&rsquo;t know if I would prefer auditing health care clients, banks, or non-profits. But if a company specializes in banking audits, or construction audits, that is a very valuable factoid to throw out there. Another key to asking questions is not to lose your flexibility. Sure, their website says that they focus on health care clients, but most firms will have clients outside of their focus area too, and you may be talking to a professional at the firm who has never had a healthcare client.</p>

<p>So ask &ldquo;I read on your website that you focus on healthcare clients. Do you work on only healthcare clients, or do you have a lot of clients in other industries too?&rdquo; And then depending on how the professional answers, you have a follow up question.</p>

<p>But <em>don&rsquo;t</em> make it sounds like you&rsquo;re <em>only</em> interested in healthcare, <em>and</em> don&rsquo;t make it sound like working on 100% healthcare is your worst nightmare. Chances are, at a firm with a specialty, there are some people who will work 100% on the specialty, and others who will hardly touch it, so you don&rsquo;t want to commit to either one without knowing more.</p>

<p><em>Website Hint: Check out the part of the accounting firm&rsquo;s website called &ldquo;Our Clients&rdquo; and read the blurb there - even if it is directed at the clients themselves, it should tell you something about the type of clients that the accounting firm is targeting.</em></p>

<p><strong>Take note of a firm&rsquo;s practice areas</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re <em>really</em> interested in forensic accounting, make sure you tell that to the firms that actually have a forensic accounting arm. Our firm does a bit of investigation into fraud, but that is NOT anyone&rsquo;s full time job here. Plus, at a firm like ours where we mostly do tax and audit, and then will help out a client with looking into employee fraud, you&rsquo;ll typically get to work on the fraud case after you&rsquo;re experienced with audit and that particular client. So, there&rsquo;s a chance for it, but if you are aiming for a masters in forensic accounting, we know that we&rsquo;re not the right place for you. If it&rsquo;s just something you <em>think</em> you <em>might</em> interested in, I suggest not making a big deal out of that to a firm that doesn&rsquo;t have it listed as a practice area.</p>

<p><em>Website Hint: Check out the part of the accounting firm&rsquo;s website called &ldquo;Services&rdquo; for more information about the firm&rsquo;s practice areas. But, be careful because the firm may list services that aren&rsquo;t a huge part of their offerings - again, it gives your a starting point for asking informed questions, but don&rsquo;t assume anything.</em></p>
