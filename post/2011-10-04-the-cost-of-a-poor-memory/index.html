Is your memory the culprit for your poor financial standing? How many times have you forgotten to pay a bill in the past year? The past month? The past week?

If you are in need of credit cards for bad credit, you may already be suffering from the consequences of having a bad memory.

When you forget to make a payment, your credit is affected. Your rating can go down and if it becomes a habit, you may not be able to open any lines of credit. It takes time to get the rating back up and get your financial standing back to a stable level.

But it isn&rsquo;t just about your credit rating. Your late payments are costing you money. It might be one of the reasons you are looking for credit cards for bad credit.

<p>Is your memory the culprit for your poor financial standing? How many times have you forgotten to pay a bill in the past year? The past month? The past week?</p>

<p>If you are in need of credit cards for bad credit, you may already be suffering from the consequences of having a bad memory.</p>

<p>When you forget to make a payment, your credit is affected. Your rating can go down and if it becomes a habit, you may not be able to open any lines of credit. It takes time to get the rating back up and get your financial standing back to a stable level.</p>

<p>But it isn&rsquo;t just about your credit rating. Your late payments are costing you money. It might be one of the reasons you are looking for credit cards for bad credit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>One of the most eye opening experiences you can have is adding up all of the late fees that you have paid off the course of the last year, or the last month.</p>

<p>As you look at the total, what else would you have rather done with the money? Could you have gone on vacation, put that money in savings, or spent some extra time at the mall? In order to get your credit back on track and save yourself some money, it is time to provide your memory with a little bit of assistance.</p>

<p>Online banking is becoming more and more popular. While most people love the convenience, they may not realize that the bank&rsquo;s website can help your memory and your credit rating.</p>

<p>Using automatic bill pay, you can set up all of your bills and have the bank mail them or credit them electronically. This makes sure everything gets paid.</p>

<p>You can set these payments up to happen automatically each and every month. Just choose a day of the month when you know you will have the money (usually immediately following payday) and have the money withdrawn automatically. You don&rsquo;t have to press a button, all the work is done for you.</p>

<p>The bank can send you an email to remind you of the payment a few days before they send it or they can email you once the payment is made. That way, if you forgot about the bill, you will know that it was paid and remember to subtract that amount out of the account when you go to balance the books.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t the type of person that likes online banking, there is nothing wrong with a pen and a piece of paper. Do you have a calendar or planner that you look at frequently?</p>

<p>You can always write in the days that you bills are due as well as how much you need to pay. When you look at the calendar it will remind you to get everything taken care of.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a hint: make your due date a few days earlier than the credit card company&rsquo;s due date. If something does happen, you will still have a few days to get things straight again.</p>

<p>If you receive paychecks on a regular schedule throughout the month, choose one or two days a month to take care of all the bills. Schedule these days immediately following a payday. You can go through every bill, make a payment and know exactly how much money you have in the bank.</p>

<p>Some utility companies, credit cards companies and banks will allow you to change your due date. If this is the case, try to clump them together to make it easier to pay things all at one time.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let your memory be the reason that you are losing money and credit standing each month. Make at least one change in order to get yourself back on track and making payments on time, consistently.</p>
