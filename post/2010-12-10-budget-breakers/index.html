			<p>I have been using Mint.com to budget with since June. It has made a big difference to me, since it is a really awesome way to easily keep track of spending and my budget. My spending habits have definitely improved since I signed up with the budgeting website, but I still struggle with going over my budget fairly frequently due to unexpected expenses.</p>

<p>My car is a good example. I last got it serviced a few months ago - it was a big milestone, and cost me about $500. I certainly didn&rsquo;t realize I&rsquo;d have to work that much into my budget. So today I had my next service. Should be much more affordable right? Everything big got taken care of 5,000 miles ago.</p>

<p>Au contraire. Today&rsquo;s little trip to the car doctor cost me over $250. Apparently my brake pads were too worn down :(.</p>

<p>So maybe I need to add a new category to my budget: Car servicing, $100/month.</p>

<p>But the unbudgeted expenses seem to come up every month. In October, it was some vet bills for routine vaccinations that were far more expensive than I expected. (I moved recently, and it turns out that vets were much more affordable in my old town.)</p>

<p>In November, I moved to a new apartment, closer to work. So, I had some large deposits to pay, as well as first month&rsquo;s rent. It’s definitely worth the slight increase in rent, but moving always seem to come with expensive Wal-Mart trips for things I &ldquo;need&rdquo; at the new place. How have I lived in apartments for the last 5 years but I still don&rsquo;t have everything I could possibly need?</p>

<p>I am adding a category called &ldquo;unexpected expenses&rdquo; to my budget during 2011. Of course, some of these expenses shouldn&rsquo;t have been unexpected, so I&rsquo;ll be adding some additional categories to try and plan a little better. And then I can see where I can save money in those categories!</p>

<p><em>Does anyone else find themselves with large, unexpected expenses month after month? What is your strategy for handling these expenses?</em></p>
