Here&rsquo;s the back story
I moved into the house I&rsquo;m living in now at the end of November last year (2010.) At the time, the house was owned by a couple N and J, but my roommate L had signed the whole lease herself in September, and then found R, our other roommate, and myself to move in and split the rent." />

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s the back story</strong></p>

<p>I moved into the house I&rsquo;m living in now at the end of November last year (2010.) At the time, the house was owned by a couple N and J, but my roommate L had signed the whole lease herself in September, and then found R, our other roommate, and myself to move in and split the rent.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign a lease when I moved in, and I didn&rsquo;t really want to, because I started looking into buying a house and didn&rsquo;t want to commit to anything.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>The new situation</strong></p>

<p>In April, L bought our house from the land lords, who were only too happy to be rid of it. She got a very good deal, and already had 2 tenants (R and myself) paying enough rent to cover the mortgage.</p>

<p>She started mentioning needing to put together a lease, and I think her parents were bugging her to get us to sign something.</p>

<p><strong>Today&rsquo;s lease situation</strong></p>

<p>Today, my roommate finally brought home a copy of my lease, with my name spelled right. I believe she was expecting me to read it through, sign it, and give it back to her today - but that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Issue 1: Lease cancellation terms</strong></p>

<p>The language of the lease states that the lease term begins May 1st, and that in the event of a tenant (me) moving out, all rent for the remainder of the year is due on the move-out date.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Now, I haven&rsquo;t had time to poll many people in the area, but a quick phone call to my sister confirmed that where she lives, it is typical that if a lease is broken, the tenant will owe only 2 months rent - not the remainder of the lease.</p>

<p><strong>Issue 2: Special arrangement for reduced rent</strong></p>

<p>For the last 2 months I have had a $100 reduction in rent, and this month it will be closer to $150 off, because I paid for some home improvements and L is paying me back overtime for those.</p>

<p>The lease language says that I owe $325 starting in May, so theoretically L could come back to me later and claim I didn&rsquo;t pay the full rent for those months.</p>

<p><strong>Add a little drama</p>

<p></strong></p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons I want to go into this conversation prepared.</p>

<p>1) L and I had a small argument a couple of days ago, and there is still some tension on both sides. Any disagreement with her terms could turn into a huge fight. I&rsquo;m not in a position to move to a new place quickly, since I have a 50lb dog to take with me.</p>

<p>2) I&rsquo;m worried that bringing up the clause about reduced rent will be a big &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you&rdquo; sort of thing - especially because I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t <em>plan</em> on coming back to be later and demanding that money. I may be crossing a line in a tense situation just to get some legal reassurance - and it&rsquo;s probably not necessary.</p>

<p><strong>The outcome I&rsquo;m hoping for</strong></p>

<p>I am thinking about buying my own place in November and moving out in December. Paying to cancel the whole lease would be <strong>$1,625</strong>. That&rsquo;s quite a chunk of change to add on top of closing costs and buying more furniture.</p>

<p>If we put in a 2 month clause, I&rsquo;d owe only <strong>$650.</strong></p>

<p>I think I would probably agree to 3 months, because the rent is so low, but I&rsquo;d still have to pay nearly <strong>$1,000</strong> to move out, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d find a new tenant way before that 3 months was up.</p>

<p>I also am going to write up a document detailing the reduced rent.</p>

<p><strong>So, a little help?</strong></p>

<p>I know that some of you are renters, and a bunch of you are landlords. Do you think a 2-months or 3-months rent clause at cancellation is reasonable?</p>

<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s worth it to play it on the safe side and add in some wording about the reduced rent?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p><em>Thank you for the advice! I asked the land lord if we could make it a 6-month lease starting July 1st, so it will end December 31. She easily agreed to this. Still haven&rsquo;t gotten the updated lease yet though!</em></p>
