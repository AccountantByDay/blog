			<p>Well I had a couple of goals for August:</p>

<p>Hit 160 billable hours at work</p>

<p>Get grocery spending to $200 or below</p>

<p>Save some cash towards a down payment on a house</p>

<p><strong>How did it go?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Billable Hours</p>

<p></strong>Well it was looking like I wasn&rsquo;t going to hit the billable hours target, but then the last two days I worked til past 8pm, and just barely hit 160. I am ready for a vacation! (Total hours at work in August = 206 or something. I would make a goal to have a higher percent of my hours in the office be billable, but we&rsquo;re about to hit our slow period for the year, so that wouldn&rsquo;t really make sense!)</p>

<p><strong>Food</p>

<p></strong>I spent $212 on groceries last month (I didn&rsquo;t go to the supermarket over the weekend, and now I am out of food! That may be cheating a little, except it is making m clean my cupboards out a bit with my scrounging.) So, I am close to only $200 for groceries. However, my &ldquo;eating out&rdquo; spending was $126! A lot of this was due to buying (cheap) lunch instead of bringing lunch in the first two weeks of August. So next month I&rsquo;ll try to avoid that, but it&rsquo;ll increase my grocery spending a bit? Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to have my eating out spending at $100 or lower, but it needs to be lower for the next few months to make up for overspending over the last several months.</p>

<p><strong>Saving Extra Cash</p>

<p></strong>I am trying to see how much extra cash I can squeeze out of my budget each month. This is after making investments, paying off my student loan, and setting aside a fixed amount each month for my upcoming trip to Spain. Last month I managed to put away an extra $609! I was thinking I could get $750, but this month I only had an extra $140!!</p>

<p>I had some extra spending on art supplies in August - I&rsquo;m going to aim for $0 art supply spending in September, but I do have some projects I want to get to that I need a couple of items for that I don&rsquo;t already have &hellip; Okay, so I will convince myself to use everything I have now, and then if I still am feeling creative, I can get those supplies in October.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s ahead in September?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Saving Extra Cash</p>

<p></strong>I have some extra blog income coming in this month (earned in past months.) I should get a cash inflow between $300 - 400 this month from blogging. I&rsquo;m thinking that without the extra spending on art supplies, and cutting my eating out spending to $75 or so, plus some added doctor&rsquo;s visits, I should be able to save $200 in cash, plus whatever the blogging income turns out to be.</p>

<p><strong>Annual Review for Work</p>

<p></strong>Sometime in September I will have my first annual review. I spoke to one of our partners about this, and sounds like it&rsquo;s more of a goal setting meeting than it is a review of your performance, but it does go along with bonuses and raises, so some changes may be addressed. In preparation for my review (this weekend) I want to look back over the past year, make a note of which clients I worked on, and come up with some goals I would like to set for the upcoming year.</p>

<p><strong>Blogging Goals</p>

<p></strong>After September 15th, I should have a lot more time on my hands for blogging. I am almost down to 350,000 in Alexa ranking, and would like to make it to below 300,000 by the end of the month. I will also be putting some thought into the celebration of my first anniversary of AccountantByDay.com, which is coming up in October! Something to look forward to.</p>
