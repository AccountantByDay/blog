			<p>In July, I came up with a new goal: to hoard $4,500 in cash in my savings account by the end of 2011.  I&rsquo;m not sure that I managed to save any more cash this month than in prior months, but my total cash inflow was approximately $609. You can see that reflected in my new goal-tracking widget located in the sidebar.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Expenses in July:</strong></p>

<p>I had to buy a wedding gift this month, and paid an extra $157 towards my student loan to get the balance to below $14,000! I tried to avoid eating out completely, but still had a few higher restaurant bills from paying for other people&rsquo;s meals along with my own. (Some of that was in exchange for those friends paying my way another time though, so really, that would be money I would have spent anyway.)</p>

<p><strong>Extra Cash Inflow:</p>

<p></strong>I received a check for about $330 from my pet insurance company as reimbursement for the high vet bills I had the month before. I need to appeal this claim and see if I can get some additional refund, since they disallowed so many charges.</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming Expenses in August:</strong></p>

<p>The wedding that I bought a gift for in July will take place in August. I bought a dress yesterday, which will be included with August expenses. The wedding requires quite a road trip, and a weekend away, which will entail some extra gas money and eating out. I also need to get my car serviced before making the road trip. Also, I think that I will put an extra $100 towards my student loan payment for the rest of the year in an attempt to get the balance to $10,000 by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>July, in Conclusion:</p>

<p></strong>I&rsquo;m pretty disappointed with my savings in July. I feel like this is how much cash I had been saving in a typical month before starting to cut costs. Especially since I had some extra cash inflow and no really big expenses other than the wedding present, and some I can look forward to even bigger expenses in August.</p>

<p>Then again, when I look back over the last couple months of vet bills, I have had a couple of negative months due to unusual expenses, so +600 is certainly way better than what I&rsquo;ve been able to save recently!</p>

<p>My total food spending, on restaurants and groceries combined, was $415 ($365 groceries and $110 restaurants) in July, as compared to $453 in June ($322 groceries and $131 restaurants) and $595 in May ($436 in groceries and $159 in restaurants). I&rsquo;m hoping to get this closer to $300 total in August, even with eating out on the weekend of the wedding.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m appalled anew at how much groceries cost, even when I think I&rsquo;m cutting back. Plenty of the great personal finance bloggers I follow could feed a whole family for what I&rsquo;ve been spending on groceries. August will be a month of renewed discipline in my grocery shopping!</p>
