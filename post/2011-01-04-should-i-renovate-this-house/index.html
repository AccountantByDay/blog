			<p>I have never owned a home, so I thought I would outline this situation and hope that some of you out there have some experience renovating and renting out homes, and can tell me if this is a totally naive proposal:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<p>Our land lord is thinking about selling the house my roommates and I live in, so I started doing some market research about homes in our area. The thing is, my neighborhood is kind of &ldquo;up and coming.&rdquo; It is a mix of nicely renovated rented homes, some sort of run-down homes, and a bunch of boarded up houses for sale.</p>

<p><strong>The potential purchase</strong></p>

<p>So in my search, I called an agent about a house a few doors down, which is one of the boarded up houses. I asked her how much they were asking, and she laughed at me and said &ldquo;make an offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The agent told me they&rsquo;ve recently dropped the asking price from $75,000 but she couldn&rsquo;t remember what to. (I will call her later to find out.) The property tax bill shows a fair market value of $70,000. But she also told me that the owner inherited the house from her aunt, and that she has been trying to sell it for over 8 months.</p>

<p><strong>The assessment</strong></p>

<p>I am going to take a look at the inside of the house this weekend. Even if it&rsquo;s a silly idea, sometimes I just need to satisfy my curiosity to really understand what a project like this would entail. I also want to see for sure what the layout of the interior is, and if the house is simply old, or if it&rsquo;s been trashed or destroyed in some way.</p>

<p><em>Please let me know if you have suggestions for what I should look for when I tour the house!</em></p>

<p><strong>What I know</strong></p>

<div>







The house is 1 level, probably on a slab. I <em>think</em> it may be 4 BR 1 BA, as that is a pretty typical configuration in the older houses in this area. So first, I would want to put in a second full bathroom. (3 bedroom, 2 bath would be my ideal. I can see renters sharing a bathroom with one other person, but definitely not sharing 1 bathroom between 4 people.) I have no idea what moving around walls and adding plumbing like that would cost, but the foundation should be plenty big enough for all that.







<em>I'll put lots more thought into layouts later, but maybe it would be more worth it to leave it as only 1 bathroom and only rent out 2 rooms.</em>







The backyard is a decent size, and I would switch the current chain link fence for a tall privacy fence.







The renovated homes in the neighborhood are valued at about $150,000 by the tax office, but I'm not sure if any of them could be sold for that much at the moment.







<em>So, any thoughts? Has anyone renovated an old house? What would the purchase price need to be to make remodeling worth it? Would a bank even give me a loan?</em>
